1) Why does LCQP fail at ex 9.2.2?
      - maximum penalty parameter reached (almost converged)

2) Why does Gurobi fail at HS044?

3) Why does Gurobi have low complementarity satisfaction with portfolio problems?

4) Why do MINOS and SNOPT fail for most problems (complementarities not satisfied)?

5) Read and cite 1999 Bemporad and Morari MLD

6) Restructure Paper:
      I) Intro 
            => Do recent advances, brief motivation and problem descr.
            => Related methods, solvers, formulations (including MIQP part) and limits of other methods (ref Background section)
            => Contributions of this method and this paper (also in comparison to prev LCQP paper)
            => Structure of the paper
      II) Problem formulation
            => Write the mathematical problem (mention that this matches the API of the solver)
            => Discuss desirable points (maybe address Background section)
            => Discuss global vs local solutions (maybe example here?)
      III) Background
            => Stationarity (... or example here?)
            => Existing Methods
      IV) Convergence Analysis
            => Some theorems and Lemmas
      V) Numerical Results
            => MacMPEC
            => IVOCP
            => MM
      VI) Conclusion and Future Work
